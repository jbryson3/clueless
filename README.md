[Expresso](https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso)

[Socket.io Test Suite](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/tree/master/test) it uses Expresso to do the testing.

To install Expresso, do `npm install expresso` from the command line in the clueless_skeleton directory. This has to be done locally because there are some things compiled specific to your OS. Do not add these to the git repository. You can tell git to ignore them. 

npm has to be installed as well for the above to work.
