Clueless Server Directory
==========================================================

This directory contains the first version of the server for the game.

**Launching the Server**
The main file for the server is clueless_server.js. This can be launched by issuing the command 'sudo node clueless_server.js'. This files loads the other classes as needed. 

**Testing**
Unit test for serverside code can be ran from this sub-directory with the command `test/unittest.sh`. Still need to create a batch file for Windows development.
